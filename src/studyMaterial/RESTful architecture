REST stands for Representational State Transfer
It is a stateless architecture
Every resource is defined as a URI - Uniform Resource Identifier
4 major actions performed on resources - POST(create), GET(read), PUT(edit) and DELETE(delete)
It follows HATEOAS principle - Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State - It states that no document should explain how to access and use that resource. Every response has to be intuitive to give more information of other related actions.
Eg - Say we are making a RESTful call to list mailboxes for a user, we could provide the URI to access the messages in that mailbox as part of the response.

Advantages of REST:
Independent development for client and server
Ease of scalability
Independent of language - only the exchange portocol needs to be JSON or XML
