Strengths:
==========
1. Complete ownership and responsibility of all tasks/projects assigned
	-irrespective of if I'm only a part of a small task in the complete project
	-initiate to help peers to take on more tasks/project to closure
2. Fast turn-around time with good quality of all my projects
	-I take it as a challenge to myself to complete it at the earliest possible
3. Good communicator and complete team player


Weaknesses:
===========
1. I wanted to be very involved in all my projects, so was not very good at delegation
	-I worked on it and now I'm more comfortable delegating but I'm actively involved in code reviews and feedback
	-This has helped me take on more projects (work on more projects) and also helped me enhance my mentoring skills
	-Now I'm actively involved in hiring and screening process


Accomplishment:
================
1. Take an idea from conception to design, implementation and rollout ww
	-Unsubscribe project
		-Convinced the Product Management team of the need of this feature and got it approved
		-Coming up with a design after carefully go through the RFC
		-Implementation leading a team of 3 members	
		-Code deployment, rollout and monitoring
		-Thought about localization issues for user friendly message
2. Sendas/forward security fix

Failed project/ Not so proud:
=============================
1. WireTap project 
	-Had to work on a very tight schedule with no test framework
	-Lead to some missing functionality on porting
	-Mismatch in types of the subject header
	-Missed rolling out the changes to IMAP protocol - it was the way the services are deployed
	-a config change and it lead to WT outage
	
Questions to ask the interviewer:
=================================
1. What characteristics do you look for in a successful SE at Uber?
2. What are some of the challenges of a SE at Uber?
3. What made someone stand out in the past at Uber?
4. What is the ratio of PM to dev to QA and what are the processess followed - like agile

Why Uber:
=========
1. I'm interested in working on challenges involved in distributed systems at scale adn what better than Uber
2. Also, it would be a privilege to work on a consumer facing product (Something that u worked on is being used on a daily basis)
