What is the difference between (low + high) / 2 and low + (high - low) / 2?

When you add two signed 32-bit integers, you always run the risk of overflow. 
You can try it yourself with low = 1 and high = Integer.MAX_VALUE. 
You'll notice however that the second way stops this overflow from occurring, 
and you get your expected result.
